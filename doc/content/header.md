### Preliminaries

The entire API Framework of Yilinker Express utilizes the `JSON` data format both for the request and response flow.

It is important to preface *ALL* requests to the Yilinker Express API with the following request header:

`Content-Type: application/json`


It can be assumed safely that all responses of the framework will also be in `JSON` format.
